1. The Bangle Sellers.

        Bangle sellers are we who bear
        Our shining loads to the temple fair...
        Who will buy these delicate, bright
        Rainbow-tinted circles of light?
        Lustrous tokens of radiant lives,
        For happy daughters and happy wives.

        Some are meet for a maiden's wrist,
        Silver and blue as the mountain mist,
        Some are flushed like the buds that dream
        On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,
        Some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
        To the limpid glory of new born leaves

        Some are like fields of sunlit corn,
        Meet for a bride on her bridal morn,
        Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
        Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
        Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
        Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.

        Some are purple and gold flecked grey
        For she who has journeyed through life midway,
        Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
        And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
        And serves her household in fruitful pride,
        And worships the gods at her husband's side.

2. The Pardah Nashin

        HER life is a revolving dream
        Of languid and sequestered ease;
        Her girdles and her fillets gleam
        Like changing fires on sunset seas;
        Her raiment is like morning mist,
        Shot opal, gold and amethyst.

        From thieving light of eyes impure,
        From coveting sun or wind's caress,
        Her days are guarded and secure
        Behind her carven lattices,
        Like jewels in a turbaned crest,
        Like secrets in a lover's breast.

        But though no hand unsanctioned dares
        Unveil the mysteries of her grace,
        Time lifts the curtain unawares,
        And Sorrow looks into her face . . .
        Who shall prevent the subtle years,
        Or shield a woman's eyes from tears? 

3. The Cold Within

        Six humans trapped by happenstance
        In bleak and bitter cold.
        Each one possessed a stick of wood
        Or so the story's told.

        Their dying fire in need of logs
        The first man held his back
        For of the faces around the fire
        He noticed one was black.

        The next man looking 'cross the way
        Saw one not of his church
        And couldn't bring himself to give
        The fire his stick of birch.

        The third one sat in tattered clothes
        He gave his coat a hitch
        Why should his log be put to use
        To warm the idle rich?

        The rich man just sat back thought
        Of the wealth he had in store
        And how to keep what he had earned
        From the lazy shiftless poor.

        The black man's face bespoke revenge
        As the fire passed from his sight
        For all he saw in his stick of wood
        Was a chance to spite the white.

        The last man of this forlorn group
        Did nought except for gain
        Giving only to those who gave
        Was how he played the game.

        Their logs held tight in death's still hands
        Was proof of human sin
        They did not die from the cold without
        They died from the cold within.

4. The Prisoner.

        In the dungeon-crypts idly did I stray,
        Reckless of the lives wasting there away;
        “Draw the ponderous bars! open, Warder stern!”
        He dared not say me nay—the hinges harshly turn.

        “Our guests are darkly lodged,” I whisper’d, gazing through
        The vault, whose grated eye showed heaven more gray than blue;
        (This was when glad Spring laughed in awaking pride;)
        “Ay, darkly lodged enough!” returned my sullen guide.

        Then, God forgive my youth; forgive my careless tongue;
        I scoffed, as the chill chains on the damp flagstones rung:
        “Confined in triple walls, art thou so much to fear,
        That we must bind thee down and clench thy fetters here?”

        The captive raised her face; it was as soft and mild
        As sculptured marble saint, or slumbering unwean’d child;
        It was so soft and mild, it was so sweet and fair,
        Pain could not trace a line, nor grief a shadow there!

        The captive raised her hand and pressed it to her brow;
        “I have been struck,” she said, “and I am suffering now;
        Yet these are little worth, your bolts and irons strong;
        And, were they forged in steel, they could not hold me long.”

        Hoarse laughed the jailor grim: “Shall I be won to hear;
        Dost think, fond, dreaming wretch, that I shall grant thy prayer?
        Or, better still, wilt melt my master’s heart with groans?
        Ah! sooner might the sun thaw down these granite stones.

        “My master’s voice is low, his aspect bland and kind,
        But hard as hardest flint the soul that lurks behind;
        And I am rough and rude, yet not more rough to see
        Than is the hidden ghost that has its home in me.”

        About her lips there played a smile of almost scorn,
        “My friend,” she gently said, “you have not heard me mourn;
        When you my kindred’s lives, MY lost life, can restore,
        Then may I weep and sue,—but never, friend, before!

        “Still, let my tyrants know, I am not doomed to wear
        Year after year in gloom, and desolate despair;
        A messenger of Hope comes every night to me,
        And offers for short life, eternal liberty.

        “He comes with western winds, with evening’s wandering airs,
        With that clear dusk of heaven that brings the thickest stars.
        Winds take a pensive tone, and stars a tender fire,
        And visions rise, and change, that kill me with desire.

        “Desire for nothing known in my maturer years,
        When Joy grew mad with awe, at counting future tears.
        When, if my spirit’s sky was full of flashes warm,
        I knew not whence they came, from sun or thunder-storm.

        “But, first, a hush of peace—a soundless calm descends;
        The struggle of distress, and fierce impatience ends;
        Mute music soothes my breast—unuttered harmony,
        That I could never dream, till Earth was lost to me.

        “Then dawns the Invisible; the Unseen its truth reveals;
        My outward sense is gone, my inward essence feels:
        Its wings are almost free—its home, its harbour found,
        Measuring the gulph, it stoops and dares the final bound,

        “Oh I dreadful is the check—intense the agony—
        When the ear begins to hear, and the eye begins to see;
        When the pulse begins to throb, the brain to think again;
        The soul to feel the flesh, and the flesh to feel the chain.

        “Yet I would lose no sting, would wish no torture less;
        The more that anguish racks, the earlier it will bless;
        And robed in fires of hell, or bright with heavenly shine,
        If it but herald death, the vision is divine!”

        She ceased to speak, and we, unanswering, turned to go—
        We had no further power to work the captive woe:
        Her cheek, her gleaming eye, declared that man had given
        A sentence, unapproved, and overruled by Heaven.
