1. The Bangle Sellers.

    Bangle sellers are we who bear
    Our shining loads to the temple fair...
    Who will buy these delicate, bright
    Rainbow-tinted circles of light?
    Lustrous tokens of radiant lives,
    For happy daughters and happy wives.

    Some are meet for a maiden's wrist,
    Silver and blue as the mountain mist,
    Some are flushed like the buds that dream
    On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,
    Some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
    To the limpid glory of new born leaves

    Some are like fields of sunlit corn,
    Meet for a bride on her bridal morn,
    Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
    Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
    Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
    Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.

    Some are purple and gold flecked grey
    For she who has journeyed through life midway,
    Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
    And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
    And serves her household in fruitful pride,
    And worships the gods at her husband's side.

2. The Pardah Nashin

        HER life is a revolving dream
        Of languid and sequestered ease;
        Her girdles and her fillets gleam
        Like changing fires on sunset seas;
        Her raiment is like morning mist,
        Shot opal, gold and amethyst.

        From thieving light of eyes impure,
        From coveting sun or wind's caress,
        Her days are guarded and secure
        Behind her carven lattices,
        Like jewels in a turbaned crest,
        Like secrets in a lover's breast.

        But though no hand unsanctioned dares
        Unveil the mysteries of her grace,
        Time lifts the curtain unawares,
        And Sorrow looks into her face . . .
        Who shall prevent the subtle years,
        Or shield a woman's eyes from tears?
