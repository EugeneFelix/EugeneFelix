1. The Bangle Sellers.

        Bangle sellers are we who bear
        Our shining loads to the temple fair...
        Who will buy these delicate, bright
        Rainbow-tinted circles of light?
        Lustrous tokens of radiant lives,
        For happy daughters and happy wives.

        Some are meet for a maiden's wrist,
        Silver and blue as the mountain mist,
        Some are flushed like the buds that dream
        On the tranquil brow of a woodland stream,
        Some are aglow wth the bloom that cleaves
        To the limpid glory of new born leaves

        Some are like fields of sunlit corn,
        Meet for a bride on her bridal morn,
        Some, like the flame of her marriage fire,
        Or, rich with the hue of her heart's desire,
        Tinkling, luminous, tender, and clear,
        Like her bridal laughter and bridal tear.

        Some are purple and gold flecked grey
        For she who has journeyed through life midway,
        Whose hands have cherished, whose love has blest,
        And cradled fair sons on her faithful breast,
        And serves her household in fruitful pride,
        And worships the gods at her husband's side.

2. The Pardah Nashin

        HER life is a revolving dream
        Of languid and sequestered ease;
        Her girdles and her fillets gleam
        Like changing fires on sunset seas;
        Her raiment is like morning mist,
        Shot opal, gold and amethyst.

        From thieving light of eyes impure,
        From coveting sun or wind's caress,
        Her days are guarded and secure
        Behind her carven lattices,
        Like jewels in a turbaned crest,
        Like secrets in a lover's breast.

        But though no hand unsanctioned dares
        Unveil the mysteries of her grace,
        Time lifts the curtain unawares,
        And Sorrow looks into her face . . .
        Who shall prevent the subtle years,
        Or shield a woman's eyes from tears? 

3. The Cold Within

        Six humans trapped by happenstance
        In bleak and bitter cold.
        Each one possessed a stick of wood
        Or so the story's told.

        Their dying fire in need of logs
        The first man held his back
        For of the faces around the fire
        He noticed one was black.

        The next man looking 'cross the way
        Saw one not of his church
        And couldn't bring himself to give
        The fire his stick of birch.

        The third one sat in tattered clothes
        He gave his coat a hitch
        Why should his log be put to use
        To warm the idle rich?

        The rich man just sat back thought
        Of the wealth he had in store
        And how to keep what he had earned
        From the lazy shiftless poor.

        The black man's face bespoke revenge
        As the fire passed from his sight
        For all he saw in his stick of wood
        Was a chance to spite the white.

        The last man of this forlorn group
        Did nought except for gain
        Giving only to those who gave
        Was how he played the game.

        Their logs held tight in death's still hands
        Was proof of human sin
        They did not die from the cold without
        They died from the cold within.
